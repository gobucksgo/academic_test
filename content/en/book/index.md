This book presents various structural econometric tools used in macroeconomics.
The word “structural” has been defined in many ways. In this book, “structural”
means that explicit assumptions are made in econometric methods so that estimators
or test statistics can be interpreted in terms of an economic model (or models) as
explained in Chapter 1.

Many applied macroeconomists link macroeconomic models with econometric
methods in this sense of structural econometrics. In principle, recent advances of
theoretical time series econometrics make this task easier because they often relax
the very restrictive assumptions made in conventional econometrics. There are many
textbooks that explain these advanced econometric methods. It is often difficult,
however, for applied researchers to exploit these advances because few textbooks in
time series econometrics explain how macroeconomic models are mapped into advanced
econometric models.[^1] To fill this gap, this book presents methods to apply
advanced econometric procedures to structural macroeconomic models. The econometric
methods covered are mainly those of time series econometrics, and include the
generalized method of moments, vector autoregressions, and estimation and testing
in the presence of nonstationary variables.

Since this book focuses on applications, proofs are usually omitted with references
given for interested readers. When proofs are helpful to understand issues that
are important for applied research, they are given in mathematical appendices. Many
examples are given to illustrate concepts and methods.

This book is intended for an advanced graduate course in time series econometrics
or macroeconomics. The prerequisites for this course would include an introduction
to econometrics. This book is also useful to applied macroeconomic researchers
interested in learning how recent advances in time-series econometrics can be used to
estimate and test structural macroeconomic models.

[^1]: For example, Hamilton (1994) contains exceptional volume of explanations of applications for a
time series econometrics textbook, but its main focus is on econometrics, and not on the mapping
of economic models into econometric models.
